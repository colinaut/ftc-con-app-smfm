The Fetal Treatment Center is proud of its 40-year legacy in fetal evaluation and treatment. Since its founding in 1981, the center has expanded its vision to incorporate dynamic new methods for diagnosis and treatment based on the emerging fields of maternal-fetal genetics and precision medicine.

**Coordinated care at multiple campuses:** Our Fetal Treatment Center is located in a children’s hospital, which facilitates our ability to offer comprehensive, family-centered care from diagnosis and prenatal management through postnatal care and long-term follow-up.

**Advanced diagnostics and interventions:** Our multidisciplinary approach incorporates the knowledge and expertise of leaders from perinatology, surgery, genetics, radiology, nursing, anesthesia, cardiology and neonatology.

**Experience that helps us provide the best possible care:** Our large patient volume and the diversity of cases we see give us a depth and breadth of experience that helps us provide the best care possible.

**Nationally ranked pediatric specialties:** UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospitals are consistently ranked among the best in the nation by U.S. News & World Report’s annual survey of children’s hospitals. Babies delivered here have immediate access to more than 150 pediatric experts in 50 specialties.
