# {title}

The Fetal Heart & Brain Study aims to determine whether we can predict early in fetal life which children are going to be at highest risk for these differences so that we can think of ways to intervene earlier, beginning in utero. To do this we are using novel imaging techniques including fetal brain MRI and fetal echocardiography to study the heart and brain of fetuses affected with complex forms of congenital heart disease. After birth, we continue to study the heart and brain using a combination of imaging and standardized developmental tests that are administered by specialized members of the study team.
