## Leaders In Genomics And Precision Based In Utero Diagnosis And Care

Since its founding in 1981, the UCSF Fetal Treatment Center has expanded its vision to incorporate dynamic new methods for fetal diagnosis and treatment based on the emerging fields of maternal-fetal genetics and precision medicine.

Advances in prenatal imaging technologies allow the experts at the UCSF Fetal Treatment Center to offer comprehensive early anatomic evaluations. These specialized examinations are conducted by maternal-fetal medicine specialists and cardiologists trained in advanced prenatal diagnosis. Early fetal anatomy evaluations are particularly useful for patients who are at high risk of having a fetal malformation.

The early anatomy evaluation incorporates advances in ultrasound technology that allow improved visualization of fetal anatomy at all gestation stages. This early anatomy evaluation is optimally performed at 12 to 14 weeks. The evaluation is appropriate for several clinical indications such as abnormalities suspected during nuchal translucency (NT) ultrasound, a family history of fetal anomalies, abnormal results on prenatal screening, multiple gestations, and pregestational diabetes.

The benefits of early anatomic evaluation include early access to targeted diagnostic testing and follow-up imaging such as early fetal echocardiography, the opportunity to make more informed decisions regarding the pregnancy, and early reassurance for patients with normal results.

## Evaluation Program Features

### Early Anatomic Evaluation

Clinical indications for early anatomic evaluation include the following:

* Abnormality suspected during nuchal translucency (NT) ultrasound
* Enlarged NT measurement (>3.5mm)
* Family history of a fetal anomaly
* History of a prior pregnancy with a fetal abnormality
* Monochorionic twins
* Poorly controlled pregestational diabetes (hemoglobin A1c >8.5 percent)
* Teratogen exposure

### Early Fetal Echocardiography

Fetal echocardiography, optimally performed at 12 to 14 weeks into pregnancy, can accurately identify heart structures and function, potentially uncovering heart disease. The combination of accumulated experience and improvements in imaging technology, e.g., high-frequency transducers, makes these early fetal echocardiograms an important diagnostic option.

Clinical indications for early fetal echocardiography include the following:

* Suspected cardiac abnormality on early anatomic evaluation or nuchal
translucency (NT) ultrasound
* Enlarged NT measurement (>3.5mm)
* Parental history of congenital heart disease
* History of a prior pregnancy with a fetal heart defect
* Multiple gestations, especially monochorionic twins
* Poorly controlled pregestational diabetes (hemoglobin A1c >8.5 percent)

## Why Refer To UCSF?
