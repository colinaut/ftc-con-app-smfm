Next generation sequencing (NGS) is one area of precision medicine that holds promise for the diagnosis and treatment of fetal congenital anomalies, genetic disorders and other complications of pregnancy. This technology allows UCSF clinicians and researchers to examine the exome and to better understand and treat fetal conditions.

The UCSF Center for Maternal-Fetal Precision Medicine is leading new advances in gene-based interventions for fetal care. Two clinical trials of exome sequencing are now underway through the Center for Maternal-Fetal Precision Medicine at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospitals.

## Benefits of exome sequencing

- Thousands of genes can be analyzed at the same time, rather than testing one or a few genes at a time.
- Exome sequencing may identify or rule out specific treatments for a patient’s individual diagnosis (though exome sequencing does not always produce actionable findings).
- Results can provide information about the chance of recurrence of the same condition in another pregnancy, and allow for more accurate prenatal diagnosis in the future.
