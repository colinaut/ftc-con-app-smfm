title: In Utero Enzyme Replacement Therapy

# {title}

Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are inborn errors of metabolism that are caused by a mutation coding for a critical enzyme. This causes an abnormal build-up of toxic materials throughout the body. LSDs cause severe multi-organ damage, including neurodegeneration, cardiac problems, impaired growth, and enlarged spleen and liver. While each LSD is a rare disease, collectively LSDs affect 1 in 5000 births.

This is a phase 1 clinical trial of in utero (meaning before birth) enzyme replacement therapy for fetuses with certain LSDs. The purpose of this study is to test the safety (to the fetus and the mother) and feasibility (meaning how easy is it to do) of enzyme replacement therapy in fetuses with these diseases. Standard care for these diseases involves giving enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) after birth.
